				"content_html": "<p>Southampton have a somewhat swollen squad this season after significant recruitment and failing to move on a few names that are really surplus to requirements. As we reach the second international break here&rsquo;s a few notes after 6 games. ⚽</p>\n<p>Starting at the back Ramsdale has had a solid start. In a team that gives up so many chances and hasn&rsquo;t won a game it&rsquo;s hard to say if he&rsquo;ll be worth points come the end of the season. McCarthy has had limited time and largely has been what we&rsquo;d expect of him. Personally, I&rsquo;d have been happy to take McCarthy in goal and spend £20m+ on attacking talent - a more pressing need IMHO.</p>\n<p>Sugawara was presumably signed on the assumption that KWP would leave. He didn&rsquo;t. Yuki looks good so far but after a couple of recent mistakes (alongside our general defensive struggles) I&rsquo;d be tempted to slot KWP back in for a while. KWP is a top-half right back and I&rsquo;m not a fan of sticking him out left - it doesn&rsquo;t get the best from him and unbalances us. Bree is also available here but he&rsquo;s a clear third choice.</p>\n<p>The centre of defence is two or three from Bednarek, THB and Stephens with Edwards, Wood and ABK as backup. Not seen much of the latter three but my preference (like most fans I suspect) is THB and Bednarek. There are mistakes in there but with time I think they can build a strong partnership. THB has done well since coming back in and should grow. Stephens is a reasonable third choice. Martin possibly over-values his leadership and fans under-state his qualities. He&rsquo;s a perfectly fine CB for our level right now, but behind the other two. Edwards, ABK, and Wood aren&rsquo;t really close to the first team right now.</p>\n<p>If you exclude KWP we&rsquo;re actually a bit light at left back. Taylor is my preference here at the moment. A balanced back four is important and he can give us that. Not the most attacking, but gives us what we need to get more solid and develop from there. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of Manning (although he seemingly did well against Arsenal). With Larios not really close at the moment KWP is (reluctantly) the best reserve here with Manning behind him in the pecking order.</p>\n<p>Our midfield is where the real headaches start and it only gets worse as you move forward. Whilst the back line isn&rsquo;t that strong it&rsquo;s at least relatively clear. I&rsquo;m still not certain we&rsquo;ve settled on our best midfield. That said, Downes is probably a clear choice. There&rsquo;s a reason he dropped to the Championship but I think he&rsquo;s got enough to step up and he&rsquo;s mostly showing it. However, like others, he needs to cut the mistakes.</p>\n<p>Fernandes has been really impressive. Still very young but I&rsquo;m excited to see how he develops, I think he&rsquo;s already next on the team sheet after Downes if Lallana isn&rsquo;t available Adam&rsquo;s minutes are being heavily managed but playing an hour in every four or five is possibly more disruptive than helpful. Ideally we&rsquo;d get him on the pitch more.</p>\n<p>Smallbone has been out for a while, I think he&rsquo;s not quite at the level and will be useful depth but I&rsquo;d be surprised to see him force a regular place. Aribo is a bit of an enigma. At his best he gives us something unique but he doesn&rsquo;t always bring it. Ugochukwu has shown promise and inexperience in equal measure but is likely our best cover for Downes. How much we develop him before sending him back to Chelsea is an interesting question.</p>\n<p>My preferred midfield three is Downes, Aribo and either Fernandes or Lallana. Not sure that&rsquo;s ever going to set the world on fire!</p>\n<p>If the midfield three is uninspiring the front three is genuinely worrying and why I&rsquo;d have liked to have spent some of that Ramsdale fee elsewhere. The ray of light here is Dibling. He&rsquo;s been excellent so far but still needs careful management. We shouldn&rsquo;t be relying on an 18 year old kid but we are and we should play him whenever we can without risking him. We do have some depth on the right with Amo-Ameyaw and exciting prospect (if behind Dibling in his development) and Cornet a very capable backup. This is probably also Armstrong&rsquo;s best position. Again, he didn&rsquo;t really hit the Premier League running and at this point it feels like the Championship is his natural level.</p>\n<p>The left side is a riddle that Martin is yet to solve. We&rsquo;re really struggling here. Fraser might be the best answer we have, or more likely tohe only option. Sulemana seems to be permanently injured and has yet to show any evidence he can compete at this level. Diaz looks completely lost out there. If that&rsquo;s his preferred position we should give up on him now. Personally, I think he&rsquo;s best considered in the striker role.</p>\n<p>That central position is a battle between Stewart, Brereton Diaz, Archer and Onuachu. A worryingly thin set of options. Archer is probably the best prospect, but it&rsquo;s a lot to ask of the youngster. A great finish against Arsenal is indicative of the potential and we must hope like crazy he can find a run.</p>\n<p>I feel for Stewart who seems cursed, but also doesn&rsquo;t really look like the answer. He did well against Bournemouth but without any goal threat. Onuachu seems to be forcing his way into Martin&rsquo;s thoughts and clearly knows his way to goal, can he do it at this level? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>\n<p>Overall we&rsquo;re about where many might have predicted. Too leaky at the back and without enough goal threat at the front. I don&rsquo;t have a particular issue with the tactics or setup, but we must take more risks going forward and put more pressure on opposition defences. Keeping the ball the way we do is no threat to PL defences and opponents will just wait for our inevitable mistakes.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re capable of causing trouble when we move forward with more intent. Too early to panic and there has been a few shoots of promise, but we must improve our defensive stability and learn to be more incisive in transition.</p>",

I've never been a big fan of Manning (although he seemingly did well against Arsenal). With Larios not really close at the moment KWP is (reluctantly) the best reserve here with Manning behind him in the pecking order.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur midfield is where the real headaches start and it only gets worse as you move forward. Whilst the back line isn't that strong it's at least relatively clear. I'm still not certain we've settled on our best midfield. That said, Downes is probably a clear choice. There's a reason he dropped to the Championship but I think he's got enough to step up and he's mostly showing it. However, like others, he needs to cut the mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFernandes has been really impressive. Still very young but I'm excited to see how he develops, I think he's already next on the team sheet after Downes if Lallana isn't available Adam's minutes are being heavily managed but playing an hour in every four or five is possibly more disruptive than helpful. Ideally we'd get him on the pitch more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallbone has been out for a while, I think he's not quite at the level and will be useful depth but I'd be surprised to see him force a regular place. Aribo is a bit of an enigma. At his best he gives us something unique but he doesn't always bring it. Ugochukwu has shown promise and inexperience in equal measure but is likely our best cover for Downes. How much we develop him before sending him back to Chelsea is an interesting question.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy preferred midfield three is Downes, Aribo and either Fernandes or Lallana. Not sure that's ever going to set the world on fire!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the midfield three is uninspiring the front three is genuinely worrying and why I'd have liked to have spent some of that Ramsdale fee elsewhere. The ray of light here is Dibling. He's been excellent so far but still needs careful management. We shouldn't be relying on an 18 year old kid but we are and we should play him whenever we can without risking him. We do have some depth on the right with Amo-Ameyaw and exciting prospect (if behind Dibling in his development) and Cornet a very capable backup. This is probably also Armstrong's best position. Again, he didn't really hit the Premier League running and at this point it feels like the Championship is his natural level.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe left side is a riddle that Martin is yet to solve. We're really struggling here. Fraser might be the best answer we have, or more likely tohe only option. Sulemana seems to be permanently injured and has yet to show any evidence he can compete at this level. Diaz looks completely lost out there. If that's his preferred position we should give up on him now. Personally, I think he's best considered in the striker role.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat central position is a battle between Stewart, Brereton Diaz, Archer and Onuachu. A worryingly thin set of options. Archer is probably the best prospect, but it's a lot to ask of the youngster. A great finish against Arsenal is indicative of the potential and we must hope like crazy he can find a run.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel for Stewart who seems cursed, but also doesn't really look like the answer. He did well against Bournemouth but without any goal threat. Onuachu seems to be forcing his way into Martin's thoughts and clearly knows his way to goal, can he do it at this level? I'm not sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall we're about where many might have predicted. Too leaky at the back and without enough goal threat at the front. I don't have a particular issue with the tactics or setup, but we must take more risks going forward and put more pressure on opposition defences. Keeping the ball the way we do is no threat to PL defences and opponents will just wait for our inevitable mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're capable of causing trouble when we move forward with more intent. Too early to panic and there has been a few shoots of promise, but we must improve our defensive stability and learn to be more incisive in transition.\r\n\r\n",

She's managed that in the face of almost constant headwinds and has been rewarded for her efforts. Her results comfortably allow her to move on with her next adventure. Now, we have just around 10 days before she starts that new journey 111 miles away. It's going to be an emotional couple of weeks...\n",
