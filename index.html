			 <p>Match 10. Having lived in Swansea for 4 years they have a soft spot in my heart but #SaintsFC really need to win today. We&rsquo;re walking a bit of a tightrope now between mounting a challenge and watching the season fizzle out before we&rsquo;ve even got started. Long way to go, but need some results. ⚽</p>

			 <p>Match 7. Really no reason to panic this early in the season but #SaintsFC need to try and find something today. It&rsquo;s not really working so far and it&rsquo;s hard to know if the team selection is rewarding performance or clutching at straws. Will certainly be interesting to see in a tough fixture. ⚽</p>

			 <p>Another miserable day for #SaintsFC. Only 6 games in, we&rsquo;re already on the back foot. It&rsquo;s hard to see where the improvement will come from. We <em>still</em> lack a proper forward and we&rsquo;re <em>still</em> seeing the same costly errors at the back.

			 <p>A bit over a week ago we made our final journey to Hartpury to support First Born in her awards presentation and to clear away her room. It&rsquo;s been a rollercoaster couple of years for various reasons, but she&rsquo;s absolutely smashed it. Leaving with outstanding results for her course, a college prize for &ldquo;Endeavour&rdquo;, incredible personal growth and a university place lined up. The girl&rsquo;s done well. 🎓</p>

			 <p>A properly functioning democracy requires an independent judiciary. It&rsquo;s imperative that any government respect the decisions made by those appointed to interpret and apply the law, just as it&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s prerogative to change laws they don&rsquo;t agree with. Simply attacking decisions undermines the whole process. It&rsquo;s also helpful to get your facts straight.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A little summary after working my way through 12 Belgian beers gifted to me for my birthday. Largely it&rsquo;s been an enjoyable selection with just a couple of weak offerings. Mostly, these were all new to me. The Jupiler and Duvel I&rsquo;ve seen everywhere but never tried and it&rsquo;s easy to see why they&rsquo;re popular. The St. Barnadus and Westmalle are real discoveries and I&rsquo;m really happy to have found them - they&rsquo;ll be reappearing in my future for sure!</p>

			 <p>Boxing Day football and the (albeit faint) hope of a new manager bounce make for a little optimism today. West Ham have a much stronger squad and there&rsquo;s honestly not too much chance of a result for #SaintsFC, but hoping we can at least put up a fight for some festive cheer. ⚽</p>

			 <p>Hard to know what to say about today. On one hand #SaintsFC <strong>have</strong> to do better defensively. Switching off, not covering the basics is unacceptable. On the other, a clear penalty offence would likely have put us 3-1 up and we probably are comfortable from there. PL is brutal and margins are fine. ⚽</p>

			 <p>International breaks are annoying on many levels so it&rsquo;s good to have #SaintsFC back again. Big game against a tough team and one both sides will be targeting to win. Interesting lineup, feels a little light up front but that&rsquo;s largely a squad issue. Fingers crossed today gets the season moving. ⚽</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Southampton have a somewhat swollen squad this season after significant recruitment and failing to move on a few names that are really surplus to requirements. As we reach the second international break here&rsquo;s a few notes after 6 games. ⚽</p>
<p>Starting at the back Ramsdale has had a solid start. In a team that gives up so many chances and hasn&rsquo;t won a game it&rsquo;s hard to say if he&rsquo;ll be worth points come the end of the season. McCarthy has had limited time and largely has been what we&rsquo;d expect of him. Personally, I&rsquo;d have been happy to take McCarthy in goal and spend £20m+ on attacking talent - a more pressing need IMHO.</p>
<p>Sugawara was presumably signed on the assumption that KWP would leave. He didn&rsquo;t. Yuki looks good so far but after a couple of recent mistakes (alongside our general defensive struggles) I&rsquo;d be tempted to slot KWP back in for a while. KWP is a top-half right back and I&rsquo;m not a fan of sticking him out left - it doesn&rsquo;t get the best from him and unbalances us. Bree is also available here but he&rsquo;s a clear third choice.</p>
<p>The centre of defence is two or three from Bednarek, THB and Stephens with Edwards, Wood and ABK as backup. Not seen much of the latter three but my preference (like most fans I suspect) is THB and Bednarek. There are mistakes in there but with time I think they can build a strong partnership. THB has done well since coming back in and should grow. Stephens is a reasonable third choice. Martin possibly over-values his leadership and fans under-state his qualities. He&rsquo;s a perfectly fine CB for our level right now, but behind the other two. Edwards, ABK, and Wood aren&rsquo;t really close to the first team right now.</p>
<p>If you exclude KWP we&rsquo;re actually a bit light at left back. Taylor is my preference here at the moment. A balanced back four is important and he can give us that. Not the most attacking, but gives us what we need to get more solid and develop from there. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of Manning (although he seemingly did well against Arsenal). With Larios not really close at the moment KWP is (reluctantly) the best reserve here with Manning behind him in the pecking order.</p>
<p>Our midfield is where the real headaches start and it only gets worse as you move forward. Whilst the back line isn&rsquo;t that strong it&rsquo;s at least relatively clear. I&rsquo;m still not certain we&rsquo;ve settled on our best midfield. That said, Downes is probably a clear choice. There&rsquo;s a reason he dropped to the Championship but I think he&rsquo;s got enough to step up and he&rsquo;s mostly showing it. However, like others, he needs to cut the mistakes.</p>
<p>Fernandes has been really impressive. Still very young but I&rsquo;m excited to see how he develops, I think he&rsquo;s already next on the team sheet after Downes if Lallana isn&rsquo;t available Adam&rsquo;s minutes are being heavily managed but playing an hour in every four or five is possibly more disruptive than helpful. Ideally we&rsquo;d get him on the pitch more.</p>
<p>Smallbone has been out for a while, I think he&rsquo;s not quite at the level and will be useful depth but I&rsquo;d be surprised to see him force a regular place. Aribo is a bit of an enigma. At his best he gives us something unique but he doesn&rsquo;t always bring it. Ugochukwu has shown promise and inexperience in equal measure but is likely our best cover for Downes. How much we develop him before sending him back to Chelsea is an interesting question.</p>
<p>My preferred midfield three is Downes, Aribo and either Fernandes or Lallana. Not sure that&rsquo;s ever going to set the world on fire!</p>
<p>If the midfield three is uninspiring the front three is genuinely worrying and why I&rsquo;d have liked to have spent some of that Ramsdale fee elsewhere. The ray of light here is Dibling. He&rsquo;s been excellent so far but still needs careful management. We shouldn&rsquo;t be relying on an 18 year old kid but we are and we should play him whenever we can without risking him. We do have some depth on the right with Amo-Ameyaw and exciting prospect (if behind Dibling in his development) and Cornet a very capable backup. This is probably also Armstrong&rsquo;s best position. Again, he didn&rsquo;t really hit the Premier League running and at this point it feels like the Championship is his natural level.</p>
<p>The left side is a riddle that Martin is yet to solve. We&rsquo;re really struggling here. Fraser might be the best answer we have, or more likely tohe only option. Sulemana seems to be permanently injured and has yet to show any evidence he can compete at this level. Diaz looks completely lost out there. If that&rsquo;s his preferred position we should give up on him now. Personally, I think he&rsquo;s best considered in the striker role.</p>
<p>That central position is a battle between Stewart, Brereton Diaz, Archer and Onuachu. A worryingly thin set of options. Archer is probably the best prospect, but it&rsquo;s a lot to ask of the youngster. A great finish against Arsenal is indicative of the potential and we must hope like crazy he can find a run.</p>
<p>I feel for Stewart who seems cursed, but also doesn&rsquo;t really look like the answer. He did well against Bournemouth but without any goal threat. Onuachu seems to be forcing his way into Martin&rsquo;s thoughts and clearly knows his way to goal, can he do it at this level? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Overall we&rsquo;re about where many might have predicted. Too leaky at the back and without enough goal threat at the front. I don&rsquo;t have a particular issue with the tactics or setup, but we must take more risks going forward and put more pressure on opposition defences. Keeping the ball the way we do is no threat to PL defences and opponents will just wait for our inevitable mistakes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re capable of causing trouble when we move forward with more intent. Too early to panic and there has been a few shoots of promise, but we must improve our defensive stability and learn to be more incisive in transition.</p>

<p>When megalomaniacal White Goodman, the owner of a trendy, high-end fitness centre, makes a move to
take over the struggling local gym run by happy-go-lucky Pete La Fleur, there&rsquo;s only one way for La
Fleur to fight back: dodgeball. Aided by a dodgeball guru and Goodman&rsquo;s attorney, La Fleur and his
rag-tag team of underdogs launch a knock-down, drag-out battle in which the winner takes all.</p>

<p>12-year-old Mully has lost his mother and discovers his debt-ridden father stealing the charity
money they&rsquo;ve raised in her name. Grabbing the cash, Mully steals a taxi and is shocked to find a
woman, Joy, in the back seat with a baby. A straight-talking solicitor who didn&rsquo;t expect to get

the child as her own. She joins Mully on a wild journey across Ireland, stealing cars, hitch-hiking,

Whether you like the music or not it&rsquo;s a cracking show and Taylor&rsquo;s talent and acumen is undeniable. 88,500 people packed into Wembley is a sight to behold.

			 <p>Wow. Leicester dropping points against Plymouth is pretty unexpected. This Championship season keeps twisting &amp; turning. Just goes to show how tough the grind towards the end of the season is. Massive chance for #SaintsFC to apply some pressure against a tough Watford side tomorrow. Massive game. ⚽</p>

			 <p>This is great news for #F1 and interesting news for the &lsquo;25 driver market. After being mooted for the Mercedes seat and as a possible Perez replacement at Red Bull he&rsquo;s a big name off the table. I&rsquo;m not sure either of those moves were ever likely, but this certainly makes next year interesting. 🏎</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m a bit late on this one, but Lewis moving to Ferrari is a fascinating and unexpected (rather than surprising) move. It&rsquo;s been a story that just won&rsquo;t go away for a while. The lure of Maranello is as strong as ever it seems, can&rsquo;t wait to see how it pans out. I really hope they can get on top of the errors that have held them back in recent seasons. Roll on 2025. 🏎️</p>

<p>Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve
districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. Part twisted entertainment,
part government intimidation tactic, the Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which
“Tributes” must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes
who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts
as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she’s ever to return home
to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity
and life against love. The world will be watching.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/451048">Jungle Cruise</a> - <em>2023-10-29</em> - I like this film, probably more than I should. It&rsquo;s a perfect Sunday afternoon family adventure, just so much fun. Blunt and Johnson are great together and even Jack Whitehall is enjoyable. Makes me smile every time I watch it. 🎬</p>

Not because it&rsquo;s bad, but I was looking for something else and not paying attention. I was confronted with an unexpected German sex comedy. It&rsquo;s a novel idea with a largely predictable story arc whose main joke does eventually wear a little thin.

			 <p>Bit of a wake up call for Southampton today. We&rsquo;ve not played much strong opposition so far and results have been better than performances. Battered by one and lucked a draw against another of the better teams. Tough league, long season, still think we&rsquo;re looking at a lower top half finish.</p>

			 <p>The ability of a man to steal the attention away from the achievements of Spain&rsquo;s women should be surprising. Sadly, it&rsquo;s not. Even with the vast strides being made in the women&rsquo;s game, this serves as a stark reminder that there are still idiots at the highest levels looking to take advantage. I look forward to the day we can celebrate these kinds of successes without entitled idiots stealing the narrative.</p>
<p>Hopefully, strong condemnation from all areas of the game, and this principled stand from the team will force the necessary change, and drive better representation. ⚽</p>

			 <p>Incredibly proud of Child 1 today as she collects her GCSE results. School life, and Secondary School life in particular, have been a real challenge for her. For all of us. However, she&rsquo;s battled through the stress, the tears, and the challenges and come out a young lady with a good set of qualifications and a positive future.</p>
<p>As important as academic achievement is we&rsquo;ve always asked her to focus on hard work, good manners, and kindness. She&rsquo;s managed that in the face of almost constant headwinds and has been rewarded for her efforts. Her results comfortably allow her to move on with her next adventure. Now, we have just around 10 days before she starts that new journey 111 miles away. It&rsquo;s going to be an emotional couple of weeks&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Delighted for Lewis, and great work from Lando, disappointed for George. Tiniest of margins and hopefully the race tomorrow is competitive. Generally race pace has been a little closer the last few races, so maybe it won&rsquo;t be a one man show.</p>

			 <p>Exciting just how close that British GP qualifying is. 0.25 seconds covering second to seventh. Tiniest margins deciding that order. Hopefully a sign of good things to come later in the season, and possibly an enthralling race tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>T-20 minutes before the penultimate home Premier League match. Probably for a while. It&rsquo;s been a largely miserable season where #SaintsFC have conspired to somehow be less than the sum of their parts. An immense amount of work to be done over the summer. Here&rsquo;s hoping we can go out with a little bit of a bang at least. 🤞</p>
