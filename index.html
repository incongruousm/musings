			 <p>So this is it. #SaintsFC start back in the PL after a short vacation. Going to be a really tough season, but there are reasons to be optimistic. The squad is definitely stronger this season, the first 11 maybe only marginally so. However, if some bets pay off we may have enough to survive. ‚öΩ</p>

take over the struggling local gym run by happy-go-lucky Pete La Fleur, there&rsquo;s only one way for La
Fleur to fight back: dodgeball. Aided by a dodgeball guru and Goodman&rsquo;s attorney, La Fleur and his

woman, Joy, in the back seat with a baby. A straight-talking solicitor who didn&rsquo;t expect to get

the child as her own. She joins Mully on a wild journey across Ireland, stealing cars, hitch-hiking,

			 <p>Day four has been the wettest so far, so a pasty lunch above <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cornwall/carne-and-pendower/explore-the-beaches-at-carne-and-pendower">Pendower Beach</a> followed by a quick run to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truro_Cathedral">Truro Cathedral</a> were the order of the day. The cathedral is impressive and quite new by catherdral standards, as such it lacked some of the history of others but none of the grandeur. Capped off the day with a quick round of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Pigs">Pass the Pigs</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)">Uno</a> with the last born.

			 <p>Good performance from some of the #SaintsFC fringe players and youngsters this evening. Thought Sekou Mara had maybe his best game, great up front and working hard to help in defence. Dibling much more involved than in the earlier match. Meghoma looking like a real prospect. Positive for the future. ‚öΩ</p>

			 <p>Bit of a wake up call for Southampton today. We&rsquo;ve not played much strong opposition so far and results have been better than performances. Battered by one and lucked a draw against another of the better teams. Tough league, long season, still think we&rsquo;re looking at a lower top half finish.</p>

			 <p>The ability of a man to steal the attention away from the achievements of Spain&rsquo;s women should be surprising. Sadly, it&rsquo;s not. Even with the vast strides being made in the women&rsquo;s game, this serves as a stark reminder that there are still idiots at the highest levels looking to take advantage. I look forward to the day we can celebrate these kinds of successes without entitled idiots stealing the narrative.</p>
<p>Hopefully, strong condemnation from all areas of the game, and this principled stand from the team will force the necessary change, and drive better representation. ‚öΩ</p>

			 <p>Incredibly proud of Child 1 today as she collects her GCSE results. School life, and Secondary School life in particular, have been a real challenge for her. For all of us. However, she&rsquo;s battled through the stress, the tears, and the challenges and come out a young lady with a good set of qualifications and a positive future.</p>
<p>As important as academic achievement is we&rsquo;ve always asked her to focus on hard work, good manners, and kindness. She&rsquo;s managed that in the face of almost constant headwinds and has been rewarded for her efforts. Her results comfortably allow her to move on with her next adventure. Now, we have just around 10 days before she starts that new journey 111 miles away. It&rsquo;s going to be an emotional couple of weeks&hellip;</p>
